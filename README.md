# ApexScrimCalculator
A simple Apex scrim calculator for torunaments

This is my first code, I made a point calculator for Scrim in Apex Legends, extremely simple, just for learning purposes.

It works as follows: the total points is a calculation made is basically your position point added to the number of kills, and a maximum of 10 kills will be considered.

1st: 12 points
2nd: 9 points
3rd: 7 points
4th: 5 points
5th: 4 points
6th and 7th: 3 points
8th to 10th: 2 points
11th to 15th: 1 point
16th to 20th: 0 points

The calculation would be: your points per position + number of kills (max 10 kills) = final result

Example: my team made 3 kills and was in 5p place, so the calculation will be:
4 points (related to 5th place) + 3 (number of kills) = 7 points in this match.

I still have to learn how to make this script work for all 20 teams using this same code. I will also learn in the future how to give a final result based on points, a list of 1st to 20th place.

thanks for read! :D
